CASE ON JESS'S REMOVAL

-Offensive imagery
-Pornographic content, that was disgusting. Jesus, to people you just met as well D:< Now it's sand blasted into my mind, and I feel sick. 
----------------------------Before formation of Rule channel----------------
-Violation of rule #7 x2
-Being a Thot. I could go into more detail, but i'd rather not. Not a rule be honestly the server isn't a sex ring.

Man, I can't tell you how much you remind me of another women I knew. I will be frank, you seem nice but at least have some decenty to be polite, especially to people
who call you friends. Instead of having a go at Hannah for having a period when she can’t control it you should support her and be there for her as a friend but of course
you’re not because you’re tearing her down and telling her to shut up about it. Man, you know what. I take back what I said before. You just don't do that. That's like telling a lad
to shut up because he's been hit in the balls.

A similar pain, from what I've been told.

Yeah, sorry but you're banned. If it's banter, well fuck you don't make it obvious.


FINAL NOTE:
BANNED.

BANNER: N/A
